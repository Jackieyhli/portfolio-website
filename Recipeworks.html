	<h3> SWOT Analysis </h3>
			<p class="w500"> Strengths: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Simple and easy to use interface </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="w500"> Weaknesses: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Possibly their lack of instructional cook videos with every meal </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="w500"> Opportunities: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>  Make short cooking videos to pair along with the step by step photos for every recipe. </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="w500"> Threats: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tik Tok and apps like Tasty that utilize fast short cut videos demonstrating the cooking.
 </li>
			</ul>
				<h3> UX Analysis </h3>
				<p> <span class="w500"> Usability:</span> Easy to navigate through and find information via the interface.
 </p>

	<ul>

		<li>Requires one time purchase of $4.99 in the app store, quite small but when compared to other apps of the
same nature that are free makes FOK look less desirable
</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="w500"> Opportunities: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Add step-by-step pictures to pair along with cooking directions </li>
	</ul>

<div class="interview">
	<div class="row">
				<h3 class="block"> Interviews </h3>
			<p>	I conducted interviews to get a better sense of potential users of my future app using the following questions. </p>
			<p>1. what is your relationship like with food? (eg.,I watch my diet and eat healthy, I binge eat fast food) </p>
<p> 2. How much time do you typically spend cooking? </p>
<p> 3. What do you feel is the hardest part about cooking?</p>
<p>4. What is your level/expertise in cooking? </p>
<p>5. If you are currently using a cooking app/website tell more about your experience using it</p>
<p>6. What features would you find to be the most important in a cooking app? </p>
<p class="w500">Conclusions from Interview: </p>
<p> Finding the time to cook seemed to be a common factor in all three participates answers pertaining to the hardest part of cooking with all three participants preferring to only spend 30 minutes on it. The participants sought video, clear pictures and simple and short cooking directions in in a recipe app. </p>
